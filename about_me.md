# About Me

### Heya!! Welcome to my website!

My name is Euan \(alias of EuanB26\) and I'm a year 13 student in the UK. I'm currently doing my A-levels, studying Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Physics. I'm a co-founder of The WinRaRs, our CTF team in which we place in a range between 60th to 80th [https://ctftime.org/team/113086](https://ctftime.org/team/113086) . Our website is up and running here:

I am an active learner in the world of cyber-security, having specialised in reverse engineering and currently learning binary exploitation. This website is putting my knowledge out to the outside world, in the hopes that I can teach you, the readers, my knowledge.

This encompasses cyber-security topics, computer science topics and programming languages. It furthers my understanding of these topics, and teaching is what I like to do to help others understand.

I am also going to be making some challenges which'll be released on the John Hammond Discord server! If you would like to have a go and put some of these skills to the test, come on in and have a go!
